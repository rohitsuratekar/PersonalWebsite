                    I have always been attracted towards visual art and spent a considerable part
                    of my childhood clicking photographs from my fatherâ€™s vintage camera. Fascinated by
                    the advent of digital technology, like many others, I resorted to capturing moments
                    from my new digital camera, which was gifted to me by my father to mark my graduation
                    from college. However, my real experience with photography started when I laid my
                    hands on a SLR camera in early 2014. Soon I became a so-called amateur with photography,
                    as well as cinematography.

                    Though I like experimenting with various genres of photography, in general,
                    <b>macro photography</b> has been a personal favourite.
