        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <span>Hello :) I am Rohit Suratekar and I created this website to show off my skill(?) set! 
            I was born in typical Indian middle class family. I grew up in Kolhapur, a small city of 
            Maharashtra filled with vibrant culture. Since my childhood my dream profession shifted 
            from Becoming Pokemon Master, WWE Wrestler, Becoming Poet, Engineer to Scientist. 
            Currently I am pursing PhD in Computational Biology and trying to become what I was dreamt of.  </span>
