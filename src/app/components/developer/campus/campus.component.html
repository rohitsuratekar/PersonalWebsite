  <h2 class="title column is-12">Project Campus Demo 1.0</h2>
  <span class="dummy-spacer">‘Project Campus’ was started in 2009. It was time when Flash had recently purchased by Adobe
    from Macromedia Inc. There was hype of small flash games. After looking at click based flash games, I decided to make
    my own game. I made this game entirely from scratch in ActionScript 3.0. I used our college hostel map for making game
    this world. I never completed this game. Here I am uploading whatever beta version I completed. This is now completely
    outdated technology and I am keeping here for historical purpose. After this game, I implemented flash snippets in many
    places. One of the Online Treasure Hunt I had made for our college technical fest was pretty famous. </span>
