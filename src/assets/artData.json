As the digital era unfolded, I, like countless others, embraced the advancements in technology and began documenting moments with my new digital camera, a thoughtful gift from my father to commemorate my college graduation. Nevertheless, it was in early 2014 that my genuine journey into the realm of photography truly commenced, when I obtained an SLR camera. Since then, I have eagerly explored both photography and cinematography, embracing the label of an enthusiastic amateur in both fields."
