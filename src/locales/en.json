I was born and grew up in a middle-class family in the small city of Kolhapur in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, known for its vibrant culture. Since my childhood, my dream profession has shifted from becoming a Pokemon master, WWE wrestler, poet, engineer to finally a scientist. By the way, I know Marathi, Hindi and English. In addition, I have formally studied Sanskrit and Russian.",

    "background": "My stint with coding started with C++ during my bachelors. I also had some experience in coding for flash games in Action Script. In early 2012, I shifted to coding in higher level languages like, Perl and Matlab while pursuing a project on {codons}, which required data mining and statistics. Later on, in 2015, I gradually started shifting my coding base to Python to aid the ongoing computational biology projects in my PhD. During the course of my PhD, I have learnt various programming languages as a hobby. These were the building blocks of many projects and research assignments, some of which are open source and can be accessed from {github}.",

But soon this utility spread across campus and now it has around 400 daily users (as of March 2020)"
