In early 2012, I shifted to coding in higher level languages like, Perl and Matlab while pursuing a project on {codons}, which required data mining and statistics. Later on, in 2015, I gradually started shifting my coding base to Python to aid the ongoing computational biology projects in my PhD. During the course of my PhD, I have learnt various programming languages as a hobby. These were the building blocks of many projects and research assignments, some of which are open source and can be accessed from {github}.",
